        <p>
          I've occasionally run into situations where using an auto-incrementing ID isn't ideal.
          It's not the usual "predictable integer" concern, but the offline usage of the app.
        </p>

        <p>
        If the app needs to work offline and a user creates a new project,
        we need to assign it an ID immediately, because projectId is needed when the user starts creating tasks under that project
        And the project_id has to be generated on the client side, since there's no connection to the server.
        </p>

        <p>
        Once the internet connection is restored, well send the data to the API, including the pre-generated IDs.
        To avoid any risk of collision, it makes sense to use something like a UUID or CUID instead of relying on auto-incrementing IDs.
