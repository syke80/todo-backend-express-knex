        <p>
          As the number of projects grows, it makes sense to assign them to people - that way, everyone only sees the projects relevant to them.
          I considered creating a user table for this, but in larger companies, projects are usually handled by teams. So it's more practical to manage teams and assign entire teams to projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          But here, too, the question came up: should the Teams-Projects relationship be one-to-many or many-to-many?
        </p>

        <p>
          Long story short: I decided to keep it one-to-many for now - meaning a single team works on a project.
          The team_id field is optional (nullable), because it's totally realistic to create a project before knowing which team will handle it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Later on, it might be worth switching to a many-to-many setup - it's perfectly common for multiple teams to collaborate on a project.
          Technically, it wouldn't be hard to implement even now, but it would complicate the endpoints and the UI, which would increase the development time.
          If we're building incrementally, it's smarter to leave that for later.
